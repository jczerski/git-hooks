# About

**prepare-commit-message** adds to commit message branch name, which can be parsed be Bitbucket. It works with every git's GUIs. 
If you work on Windows you should install [grep](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/grep.htm), [awk](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/gawk.htm) and [sed](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/sed.htm) tool.

# Getting started

## Installation

To install globally, copy `prepare-commit-msg` to `/usr/local/share/git-core/templates/hooks` and execute:

```
chmod +x /usr/local/share/git-core/templates/hooks/prepare-commit-msg
```

To install per-repository, copy `prepare-commit-msg` to `/path/to/repo/.git/hooks/prepare-commit-msg` and mark it as executable.

Hooks need to be executable, so you may need to change the file permissions of the script if youâ€™re creating it from scratch. For example, to make sure that prepare-commit-msg is executable, you would run the following command:

```
chmod +x prepare-commit-msg
```

## Usage

The branch name will be automatically appended to commit messages using `git commit` or `git commit -m "message"`.

## Notes

If you'd like to use this commit message hook in an existing repository, after copying the file to the proper location, run `git init` within the repository for the hook to be initialized.
